James is a set of libraries of test utilities named after the author who wrote the book of James in the Bible.

>"Dear brothers and sisters, when troubles come your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy. For you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow."<br>
**(James 1:2-3)**
